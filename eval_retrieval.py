"""Compare baseline (raw question) vs HyDE retrieval on a small labeled question set.

A result counts as relevant when it comes from the expected paper and its section_path
starts with one of the listed sections. Off-topic questions have no relevant chunks; they
show whether a distance cutoff could separate "nothing relevant" from real matches.
